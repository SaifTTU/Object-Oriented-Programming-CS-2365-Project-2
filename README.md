# Object-Oriented-Programming-CS-2365-Project-2
# UNO Workout!
This is a joint project of Tucker Hortman and Saif Chowdhury.
We're recreating a game called Uno workout in Java. 

Note: I just added a boolean actionHand = false; in the card class. The program can now tell when the objects are action cards or not. 
Hopefully now we can use this to begin working on the action cards.
