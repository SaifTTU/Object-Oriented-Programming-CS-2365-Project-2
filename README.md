# Object-Oriented-Programming-CS-2365-Project-2
# UNO Workout!
This is a joint project of Tucker Hortman and Saif Chowdhury.
We're recreating a game called Uno workout in Java. 

Note: I just added a boolean actionHand = false; in the card class. The program can now tell when the objects are action cards or not. 
Hopefully now we can use this to begin working on the action cards.
Also Note: for now the showHand() method also adds the values of the hand, (it skips action cards) but later we should make a separate method that adds the values in one's hand. 

Also: remember to use the colText() method in the card class to print the String color of any card.

just added javax.swing functionality for the showButton dialogue stuff. I put all three options in a method titled "option(int o)" which takes in one argument, the number of the option that is being given.
